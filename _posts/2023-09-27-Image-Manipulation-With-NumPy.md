###### Important Note: 



...with the lines...

```ruby
prime = min(sorted(number_range))
number_range.remove(prime)
```

...where we firstly force the identification of the lowest number in the number_range into our prime variable, and following that we remove it.

However, because we have to sort the list for each iteration of the loop in order to get the minimum value, it's slightly slower than what we saw with pop().
